PlayStatus is a simple macOS app that allows the control of Spotify, Apple Music(macOS 10.15+) and iTunes including iTunes Radio/Beats1 playback from the menu bar.


### As of macOS Big Sur 11.3 this bug has been fixed.      
- There's a bug in macOS Big Sur 11.0-11.2.x and specific to Apple Music. Song details are not provided when using Listen Now, Browse or searching and playing songs on Apple Music. Anything within your library works just fine. This is a bug on Apple's end.

##### PS: The search functionality works only for songs present in the iTunes or Music(macOS 10.15+) library. An internet connection is needed to load album artwork for Spotify and in some instances iTunes/Music app.

## Note:
No information at all is logged and everything is local to your device. Since the app uses Apple Script to push actions to another app, it requires the user's permission to do so. Should you have any concerns please get in touch by reporting an issue or you can check out the most recent code available.
